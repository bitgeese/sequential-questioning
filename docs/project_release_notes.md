# Sequential Questioning MCP Server v1.0.0 - Release Notes

## Release Information
- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Release Date**: June 20, 2023
- **Status**: Production Ready

## Overview
We are pleased to announce the release of version 1.0.0 of the Sequential Questioning MCP Server. This release marks the completion of all planned features and the readiness of the system for production deployment. The Sequential Questioning MCP Server provides a robust platform for generating adaptive follow-up questions based on user responses, with full integration of the MCP protocol.

## Key Features

### Core Features
- **Sequential Question Generation**: Advanced algorithm for generating contextually relevant follow-up questions based on conversation history
- **MCP Protocol Integration**: Full support for the MCP protocol for seamless integration with existing systems
- **Vector Search Capabilities**: Integration with Qdrant for semantic similarity search of questions and responses
- **Conversation Management**: Complete API for creating, retrieving, and managing conversation flows
- **High Performance**: Optimized for high throughput and low latency in production environments

### Technical Features
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with domain-driven design principles
- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive API built with FastAPI for low-latency communication
- **Database Integration**: PostgreSQL for structured data and Qdrant for vector storage
- **Containerization**: Docker-based deployment with Kubernetes orchestration
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana integration for real-time performance tracking
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Support for horizontal scaling to handle increasing loads

## Improvements
